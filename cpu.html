        CPU socket on the motherboard of your computer. There are two main

      <h4>What does the CPU do?</h4>

      <p>
        The CPU is like the brain of your computer. Almost everything, whether
        it's data, memory, or basic and advanced calculations, goes through the
        CPU at some point.
