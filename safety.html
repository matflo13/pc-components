      <h2>Safety</h2>
      <p>
        To stay safe, there are many things to consider when working inside
        computers. These measures will help keep both you and the computer safe
        from damage.
      </p>
      <h3>Electrical Safety</h3>
      <p>
        We must be careful about components that still hold on to high levels of
        voltage even after the computer is off, such as the PSU. It is also
        important to be careful around the ROM and capacitors on the
        motherboard. These guidelines are important to follow to protect
        yourself and others from:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Harm</li>
        <li>Explosions</li>
        <li>Electrical Fires</li>
        <li>Electricution</li>
      </ul>

      <p>These precautions can help avoid damage to the PC components.</p>
      <h4>AC Adapters</h4>
      <p>
        If you use a different AC adapter than the one intended for your device,
        you run the risk of damaging the adapter or the computer itself. Both of
        these would happen because of voltage and current differences.
      </p>

      <h4>Electrical Grounds</h4>
      <p>
        An electrical ground is a path of least resistance for excess
        electricity to use to flow harmlessly away from a device. Some equipment
        that needs grounding is:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Equipment that handles lots of electrical power needs to have a
          ground, (e.g. computers, routers, saws, TVs, etc.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Equipment that holds / contains / is attached to other equipment that
          requires a lot of power (e.g., network racks and server racks, etc.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Electrostatic Discharge (ESD)</h4>

      <p>
        Electrostatic discharge is the sudden release of electrical current when
        two objects touch each other. It's a large concern for computer
        equipment because it can damage delicate components such as RAM or
        storage drives, and in some cases, it may partially or completely erase
        memory from your computer. The voltage needed to damage your computer is
        so little you probably won't feel it. About 5 to 10 volts of electricity
        is required to damage some components compared to the 1500 volts
        required for a person to feel ESD. However, there are many ways to help
        combat ESD damage. You can:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Use an anti-static wrist strap.</li>
        <li>Use an anti-static floor mat.</li>
        <li>Use anti-static bags.</li>
        <li>Use anti-static workbench mats.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>General & Fire Safety</h3>

      <p>
        There are many general safety precautions that should be followed when
        working on a computer. Some of the most important to remember are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Take off watches and jewelry.</li>
        <li>Don't eat or drink while working on a computer.</li>
        <li>Tape sharp edges.</li>
        <li>Clean up clutter around your workspace.</li>
        <li>Don't wear loose clothing.</li>
        <li>Wear ESD gear.</li>
        <li>Wear eye protection.</li>
        <li>Use proper lifting procedures.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These are the most important safety procedures to remember to follow.
        They will all help to keep you safe from harm while working in a
        computer.
      </p>
      <p>
        When working with PC hardware, there is always a risk of fire. Many
        things can cause the computer to light up and burn, such as extra
        remaining voltage in components, power supplies malfunctioning and more.
        Because of this, it's extremely important to remember how to use a fire
        extinguisher properly, as it can save your life. The acronym PASS can
        help you remember how to use it properly and safely. It stands for:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>P:</dt>
        <dd>Pull the pin.</dd>
        <dt>A:</dt>
        <dd>Aim at the base of the fire.</dd>
        <dt>S:</dt>
        <dd>Squeeze the lever.</dd>
        <dt>S:</dt>
        <dd>Sweep from side to side.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Using these practices, you can stay safe while working with computers.
